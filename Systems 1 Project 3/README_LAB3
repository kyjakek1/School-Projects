BY SUBMITTING THIS FILE TO CARMEN, I CERTIFY THAT I HAVE PERFORMED ALL OF TEH WORK TO DETERMINE TEH ANSWERS FOUND WITHIN THIS FILE MYSELF WITH NO ASSISTANCE FROM ANY PERSON OTHER THATN THE INSTRUCTOR OF THIS COURSE OR ONE OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE GRADERS.

I worked on this lab for approximately 20 hours

COMMENTS:
I thought that this lab was very difficult and time consuming.  That being said it was a good challenge and completing it felt like a large accomplishment.
One critique that I have is how little it is worth in the grade book.  In my opinion a 20+ hour assignment should be worth more than just 1.6% of the grade.  Having it worth that much incentivises not completing the lab fully since not doing extra work doesn't affect the grade that much.
